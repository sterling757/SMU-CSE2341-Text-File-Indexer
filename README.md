# SMUCSE2341-.Txt-Fille-Indexer
This is a project that was assigned to me during my Data Structures Class.


<b><h3>Purpose of the Project:</h3></b>

To build a program in C++ that reads in a .txt file containing an unknown quantity of words underneath an integer that represents the page number.

The program then parses the words and their respective page numbers and indexes them accordingly.

The results are then written to an output.txt file and displayed in alphabetical order, with the page numbers in ascending order.


<b>Data Structures Used</b>

I was required to create my own Vector class to use in making this. I was not allowed to use the standard library <vector> 
  
I included the DSVector.h and .cpp files in the repository


<b>Instructions</b>

In order to properly gain results, the specified .txt file must be passed through the command line as the first arg.

The .txt files syntax is very particular, with the page number being surrounded in angle brackets like so: <1>

Each word must be on its own line as I used the newline character to delimit.

Finally, to see the results, the output.txt file must also be the second arg.


Example input.txt and output.txt files have been included!
