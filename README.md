# SMUCSE2341-.Txt-Fille-Indexer
This is a project that was assigned to me during my Data Structures Class.

<b>Purpose of the Project:</b>

To build a program in C++ that reads in a .txt file containing an unknown quantity of words underneath an integer that represents the page number. </n>
The program then parses the words and their respective page numbers and indexes them accordingly. </n>
The results are then written to an output.txt file and displayed in alphabetical order, with the page numbers in ascending order.</n></n>

<b>Data Structures Used</b>

I was required to create my own Vector class to use in making this. I was not allowed to use the standard library <vector> </n>
I included the DSVector.h and .cpp files in the repository</n></n>

<b>Instructions</b>

In order to properly gain results, the specified .txt file must be passed through the command line as the first arg.</n>
The .txt files syntax is very particular, with the page number being surrounded in angle brackets like so: <1></n>
Each word must be on its own line as I used the newline character to delimit.</n>
Finally, to see the results, the output.txt file must also be the second arg.</n></n>
Example input.txt and output.txt files have been included!
